   - List items and their purchase frequencies.

3. **Print Histogram:**
   - Visual representation of item purchase frequencies.

4. **Exit:**
   - Close the program.

### Data Files

- A backup file ("frequency.dat") stores item purchase data.

## Usage

1. **Compile and Run:**
   - Compile using a C++ compiler.
   - Run the executable.

## Code Structure

1. **`main.cpp`:**
   - Main program logic.
   - Interacts with the `GrocerTracker` class.

2. **`grocer_tracker.h` and `grocer_tracker.cpp`:**
   - Define and implement `GrocerTracker` class.
   - Manages data, file I/O, and item frequencies.

## Compilation

- Compile the program using a C++ compiler.
